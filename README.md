# primeTables
A small tech test set out by the lovely people of FindMyPast.co.uk

# Introduction 

Write an application that takes numeric input (N) from a user and outputs a
multiplication table of (N) prime numbers. Our hope is that it should only take a couple of hours to
build a simple solution.

# Research

After having a quick look at the specification, I have determined that we will be using prime sieves for generating our prime number tables. 

#Requirements

- you can use whatever programming language you like for this exercise :white_check_mark:

- Do not use a brute force / trial division algorithm :white_check_mark:

- Should have a test for a performant prime algorithm that can generate a list of 20,000+ :white_check_mark:
primes

- small commits to git so that we can see how you’ve developed your :white_check_mark:
solution

- write your application with high unit test coverage :white_check_mark:

- for the input and output you can use the console, a web page, or something 
else :white_check_mark:
 
- please write an algorithm to solve the prime number generation - do not use a library method
to generate your primes :white_check_mark:

- the user should input a whole number N, where is N is at least 1 :white_check_mark:

- the application should output an N+1 x N+1 grid of numbers :white_check_mark:

# how to run it

- You can run the initial program by running the index.html page either locally or on a server.
- You can run the jamsine tests by opening the primeTables/jasmine/specrunner.js file.

# what you’re pleased with

- I'm pleased with the initial runtime that i got the prime table to compute in. Even low end spec computers will be able to process a prime table quickly. 

# what you would do with it if you had more time

 - I would perhaps add some css to make the page more usable and readable.
 - I would like to add some front end validation on the index page. 
 - I would like to pursue generating the prime table even quicker with another algorithm such as the Sieve of Sundaram.
